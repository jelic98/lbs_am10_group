### Statement of Purpose
To create intuitive visualizations that will allow consumers to make quick and informative choices about their meals when going to one of the four fast food restaurants we focused on for this project. We try to include information that will allow diverse consumers (ex: vegetarian/pescetarian, health-conscious) to come to their own conclusion about which meal from which restaurant they should get for their next meal. 

### Overview of Our Project 
In order to narrate our story, we divide our presentation into two parts and a total of 6 plots and lists: 

- **1: Healthiness assessment of each restaurant and their menu items** 
  - Calorie distribution graph for each restaurant
  - Distribution of macro-nutrient balance scores for each menu item 
  - Rankings of menu items with the best and worst balance scores
  - Clustering menu items based on their various features (beyond the macros)
- **2: Providing information for diverse consumers (vegetarians and pescetarians)**
  - Key word analysis of menu items using word cloud 
  - Finding which restaurant is more vegetarian and or pescetarian friendly

### Questions

1.  What is the distribution of calories for each restaurant? 
2.  What is the distribution of the macro-nutrient balance scores? 
3.  Which menu items from which restaurants are the the most macro-nutrient balanced (healthiest)/ least balanced (unhealthiest)? 
4.  How can we classify menu items based on various item features? 
5.  What are the major key words found in each restaurants' menus? 
6.  Which of the four fast food restuarants is most vegetarian and or pescetarian friendly?
