## Introduction 


## Statement of Purpose 
> To create intuitive visualizations that will allow consumers to make quick and informative choices about their meals when going to one of the four fast food restaurants we focused on for this project. We try to include information that will allow diverse consumers (ex: vegetarian/pescetarian, health-conscious) to come to their own conclusion about which meal from which restaurant they should get for their next meal. 

## Background and Preparation
We utilized 4 separate data sets to create our visualizations: 

- Fast food menu items 

data source 
what preparation we did 

## Methodology 

## Results and Conclusions

### Required Packages
```{r packages}
library(ggwordcloud)
library(tidyverse)
library(urbnmapr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(skimr)
library(sf)
```

### Loading the data 
```{r loading the data}
calories <- read_csv('data/fastfood_calories.csv') %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(total_prot=protein) %>%
  mutate(restaurant=str_replace_all(tolower(restaurant), '[^\\w]', '')) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(fiber),
    !is.na(total_prot),
    restaurant %in% c('mcdonalds', 'burgerking', 'tacobell', 'subway')) %>%
  select(-x1, -vit_a, -vit_c, -calcium, -salad)

restaurants <- read_csv('data/FastFoodRestaurants.csv') %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    state=if_else(province == 'Co Spgs', 'CO', province),
    name=str_replace_all(tolower(name), '[^\\w]', '')) %>%
  filter(name %in% unique(calories$restaurant)) %>%
  select(-address, -country, -keys, -postal_code, -province, -websites)

abbrevs <- read_csv('data/state-abbrevs.csv') %>%
  clean_names()

population <- read_csv('data/us_pop.csv') %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  left_join(abbrevs, by='state') %>%
  select(-state) %>%
  rename(state=abbreviation)
```

### 1: Calorie distribution 
*Question answered:* What is the distribution of calories for each restaurant? 

```{r}

```

### 2: Balance score boxplot 
*Question answered:* What is the distribution of balance scores? 

```{r}

```

### 3: Healthiest menu items 
*Question answered:* Which menu items from which restaurants are the healthiest? 

```{r}

```

### 4: Wordcloud 
*Question answered:* 
```{r}

```

### 5: Vegetarian and Pescetarian friendly restaurants
*Question answered:* Which of the four fast food restuarants is most vegetarian and or pescetarian friendly? 

In this section, we explored the calories data set to find which restaurant is most vegetarian and or pescetarian friendly 

```{r vegetarian and pescetarian plots}

## Discussion and Critique

> Through the process of carrying out our project, we learned how to visualize and manipulate data through tableau and R.  We met some problems when we tried to create density plots with tableau, we wish to solve this problem next time. Because we only picked four restaurants, To give people more solid suggestions on restaurants choices, we should include more restaurants and do more analysis. Also, because the data was originated in 2018, if possible, we should incorporate more updated and comprehensive data. Also, we mainly focused on the healthiness of the restaurants in our analysis. In the future, we can dig into the data from more varied perspectives. For example, we can check people's preferences over different ingredients across different states.
